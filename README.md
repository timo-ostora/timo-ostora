I build **reliable web applications** with a strong focus on **clean architecture, usability, and visual consistency**.

💻 Full-stack web developer (React, Next.js, Laravel, APIs)  
🎨 Strong foundation in web design and design systems  
🧠 Product-oriented mindset

My work sits at the intersection of **engineering and design execution**.

## 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜 𝗗𝗼

I design and build complete web products — from concept to production.

On the **development side**, I:
- Build full-stack applications with clear structure
- Develop REST APIs and backend logic
- Implement authentication, roles, and dashboards
- Write maintainable, readable code meant to scale

On the **design side**, I:
- Define layout rules, spacing systems, and UI consistency
- Translate design concepts into real, usable interfaces
- Ensure pixel-accurate implementation in the browser
- Design with responsiveness, accessibility, and performance in mind

I don’t separate design and development — I treat them as one workflow.

## 𝗪𝗲𝗯 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹𝘀

My design approach is practical and developer-driven.

I focus on:
- Visual hierarchy and readability
- Spacing systems and layout consistency
- Component-based UI thinking
- Design systems that developers can actually implement

Design, for me, is not decoration.  
It is a **set of rules that make interfaces predictable and usable**.

## 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗜 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸

1. Understand the problem and user context  
2. Define UI and system rules  
3. Build reusable components and clean APIs  
4. Focus on clarity before optimization  
5. Deliver solutions that are easy to maintain

My goal is always the same:  
**build systems that are simple to use and simple to evolve**.
